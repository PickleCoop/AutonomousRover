# AutonomousRover
This project is from my embedded systems class, and was the combination of many projects from that quarter. The rover utilizes sonar range detection, bluetooth, PWM modulation for the motors, and an LCD screen. The rover is turned on via bluetooth signal, and will move forward based on the code for the motors. Once an object is detected within a meter, the rover will execute a series of turns to attempt to avoid the obstacle.
